## Install NextFlow
Nextflow runs on most POSIX systems (Linux, Mac OSX etc). It can be installed by running the following commands:

```bash
# Make sure that Java v8+ is installed:
java -version

# Install Nextflow
curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash

# Add Nextflow binary to your bin PATH or any accessible path in your environment:
chmod 755 nextflow
mv nextflow ~/bin/
# OR system-wide installation:
# sudo mv nextflow /usr/local/bin
```

See [nextflow.io](https://www.nextflow.io/) for further instructions on how to install and configure Nextflow.

## Install the pipeline

### Automatic
This pipeline itself needs no installation - NextFlow will automatically fetch it from GitHub if `dolphinnext/ribosome-profiling` is specified as the pipeline name.

### Genome Data
If you're running for the first time, you need to download genome data to your DOWNDIR. You can use following command to download human genome files.

```
cd $DOWNDIR && wget -l inf -nc -nH --cut-dirs=2 -R 'index.html*' -r --no-parent https://galaxyweb.umassmed.edu/pub/genome_data/ribosome-profiling/human/
```

### Docker
First, install docker on your system: [Docker Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Then, running the pipeline with the option `-profile docker` tells Nextflow to enable Docker for this run. An image containing all of the software requirements will be automatically fetched and used from dockerhub ([https://hub.docker.com/r/dolphinnext/riboseq](https://hub.docker.com/r/dolphinnext/riboseq)).

```
nextflow run dolphinnext/ribosome-profiling -profile docker --DOWNDIR /path/to/save/ribosome-profiling --reads '*.fastq.gz' --genome_build human_hg38_gencode_v30
```

### Singularity
If you're not able to use Docker then [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/) is a great alternative.
The process is very similar: running the pipeline with the option `-profile singularity` tells Nextflow to enable singularity for this run. An docker image will be automatically converted into singularity image and used in the pipeline.

```
nextflow run dolphinnext/ribosome-profiling -profile singularity --DOWNDIR /path/to/save/ribosome-profiling --reads '*.fastq.gz' --genome_build human_hg38_gencode_v30
```
